# Giphy Finder

This app uses the Giphy API to pull a random image, or to display a collection of images based on the search term.

### Features

- The random button will display a random image from Giphy.  If clicked again, it will clear the current random image, and display another.
- The search button will search all images in Giphy, and display a collection of images based on the search term.  A repeated search will clear the previous search and display the new search.

### Issues

- The random image will clear when random is clicked again, but it is a very slow process, and may not appear to have worked for some time.

### Installation

- Requires Node, Express, and NPM
- Run npm install and npm start in the project directory
- Go to http://localhost:3000 to run the project
- Make sure to close the server using Control+C before closing the terminal!
